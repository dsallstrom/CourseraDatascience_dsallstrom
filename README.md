# CourseraDatascience_dsallstrom

This is the repository for my Getting and Clearing Data final project. It contains a script that performs the following tasks:
1) Downloads requisite data from given url and reads data into R.
2) Stacks and mergers the training and testing data into a singular dataset.
3) Uses only the mean and the standard deviation on each measurement.
4) Calculates the means of those measurements across all observations (within subject number and test type by groups)
5) Manages variable names to make them descriptive / more readable.

A codebook is also attached. See this for more information on the variable names.
